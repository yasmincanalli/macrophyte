## Description
Data and R coding to analyze the response of macrophytes to variation in transparency and depth in a Atlantic Forest wetland. These results are discussed in the manuscript  "Increasing depth reduces macrophyte coverage but increasing transparency promotes composition turnover through environmental thresholds", accepted for publication in Marine & Freshwater Research.

## How to use this directory
In R, you may download all the data contained in this repository by using the download.file() function, then use the function unzip(). Example:

`
download.file(url="github.com/yasmincanalli/macrophyte", destfile = "MS_MacrophyteThresholds.zip")
`

`
unzip(zipfile = "MS_MacrophyteThresholds.zip")
`

Analysis is summarized in a single R script. All the data necessary to run analyses are availagle in /data. In this example, we used 100 permutations for all analysis for examplifying the coding, but published analysis used 1,000 permutations.
